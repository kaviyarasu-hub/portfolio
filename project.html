         <p style="margin-left: 10px;">A software development project is a structured endeavor where a team of developers, designers, testers, and other stakeholders work together to create software that solves a specific problem or fulfills a particular need. It follows a well-defined process that includes planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Here's an overview of what typically goes into a software development project:
            Key Roles in a Software Development Project
Project Manager: Oversees the project, ensuring it's on track, within scope, on time, and within budget. The project manager coordinates between teams and stakeholders, handles risks, and communicates project progress.

Product Owner: In Agile methodologies, the product owner is responsible for the vision of the product, prioritizing features, and making key decisions regarding the product's functionality.

Software Developers: Write the code that brings the software to life. Developers typically specialize in front-end, back-end, or full-stack development.

UI/UX Designers: Design the interface and user experience to ensure the product is intuitive and easy to use.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers: Conduct testing to ensure that the software is free of bugs and works as expected. They may write test cases and automate testing procedures.

DevOps Engineers: Focus on the infrastructure, ensuring smooth deployment, and automating the process of software release and scaling.

Business Analyst: Works closely with stakeholders to understand the business requirements and translates them into technical specifications.

            Definition: This project involves creating a machine learning model that predicts the sale price of a house based on various features like size, location, number of rooms, and more.
            Goal: The goal is to develop a regression model that estimates house prices.
            Techniques:
            Linear Regression: A basic technique for predicting numerical values.
            Decision Trees & Random Forests: To handle non-linear relationships and improve accuracy.
            Support Vector Machines (SVM): For more complex, high-dimensional datasets.
            Key Concepts: Regression, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation, Overfitting/Underfitting</P>
